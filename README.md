Open Visual Studio and create a new Windows Forms App (.NET Framework) project. Copy and paste the provided code into the main form's code file (Form1.cs). 
Add necessary NuGet packages, particularly Newtonsoft.Json for JSON handling and System.Net.Http for HTTP requests, by navigating to "Project" > "Manage NuGet Packages".
http://api.mymemory.translated.net - the api implemented for translator app.
Also I didn't use Bunifu framework because I don't know how to set it up sir, I was absent that day so I used the siticone framework(Siticone.Desktop.UI) instead.
Ensure the form designer includes text boxes (textInput and textOutput), dropdown lists (SourceLanguage and TargetLanguage), and a button (buttonTranslate) with appropriate event handlers. 
After setting up the UI elements, build the project by selecting "Build" > "Build Solution" from the menu.
